## About Lua

Lua is powerful, lightweight interpreted scripting language with a small footprint. It supports multi-paradigm programming: procedural, object-oriented, functional, data-driven and data-description. Lua is rarely used as a stand-alone language. Instead Lua focuses on scripting, as “secondary” language which integrated into other software written in mainly C/C++.

Some examples of Lua’s usage areas: network software, video games, user graphical interfaces, graphics/text processing software, etc. Lua also is good for beginners to create simple video games.

Lua interpreter is written in ANSI C and it is extremely small, both interpreter and source code is only about 1Mb. Lua is considered one of the fastest interpreted languages.
